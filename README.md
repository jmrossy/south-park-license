# The South Park License

The South Park License is a software license based partly on MIT license and 
partly on the disclaimer presented before every episode of Trey Parker and Matt 
Stone's animated series South Park.

Essentially, the license stipulates that the software can be used, copied, 
modified and publicly ridiculed as the user desires.
